# QR_Code_Generator
This Python Program generates QR Codes of the link entered. Just paste the link in the terminal and hit enter and it will automatically display the QR_Code on the Screen. But it uses modules such as pypng, pyqrcode and opencv. JIf you are in Windows then just install the modules by:
```
pip install pypng
```
```
pip install pyqrcode
```
```
pip install opencv-python
```
Or if you are in Linux(Ubuntu 20.04 LTS which I am using) then use:
```
pip3 install pypng
```
```
pip3 install pyqrcode
```
```
pip3 install opencv-python
```
Or install according to your OS. After installation just run the Main.py file and type the link in your terminal. Doing this should've displayed the QR Code on your Screen. Below is my Code Screenshot:
